# OSU Research Mrm Preset

The OSU Research preset for [mrm](https://github.com/sapegin/mrm) keeps project configuration files in-sync and policies compliant across projects.

## Policies and Procedures

For folks who like to focus on policy review, the generated policies are:

* [Submitting Feature Requests](./github/templates/feature_request.md)
* [Submitting Bug Reports](./github/templates/bug_report.md)
* [Submitting Other Issues](./github/templates/issue.md)
* [Contributor Code of Conduct](./contributing/templates/code_of_conduct.md)
* [Code Contribution Guidelines](./contributing/templates/contributing.md)
* [Commit Conventions](./conventional-commits/templates/convention.md)
* [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)

For further questions regarding policies and procedures, contact Chase [mcmanning.1@osu.edu](mailto:mcmanning.1@osu.edu).

```bash
npx mrm contributing --preset osuresearch
```

For full project scaffolding, we have a few aliased variations available:
